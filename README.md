# WeatherApp

Simple weather app, consists of 2 screens: current weather and forecast weather.
App supports gps, so, you don't have to enter city name to see the weather on your current location.

I used pods like snapKit to make constraints in tableViewCell easier. Soon app will support saving images in cash

What to do:
 - Add ability to save images (NSKeyedArchiver)
 - Sort files correct by folders
 - Rewrite on MVP
